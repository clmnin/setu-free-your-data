## About the app

We are building an app to help SMEs keep track of their transactions and also help them identify bad or credit risk customers, who may default in their business credit.
Our app helps SMEs track their ledgers, track bank transactions and automatically fill transaction data and also identify bad credit worty users/customers by using both financial data from account aggregators and by usage of the app. By using the app we can identify defaulters on credits and mark them as credit risk.
